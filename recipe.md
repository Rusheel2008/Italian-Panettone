Process:

1. YEAST REFRESHMENTS AND LEAVENING

   In order to help leavening, yeast is refreshed several times adding flour and water, kneading it and leaving it to leaven.

2. FIRST KNEADING (WHITE/EVENING)

   Ingredients (yeast, flour, sugar butter and water) are put inside kneader with plunging arms.

3. FIRST LEAVENING (WHITE/EVENING)

   First kneading is left to leaven for twelve hours in a cell with controlled temperature and humidity.

4. SECOND KNEADING (YELLOW/MORNING)

   Dough is poured into the kneader. First we add again flour, sugar, water, butter and also egg yolks. Then we add candied fruit and raisins according to the recipe.

5. DOUGH IS LEFT TO REST AND DIVIDED

   Dough is left to rest for some minutes, then it is divided into pieces.

6. ROUNDING

   This phase is manually made. It gives a compact rounded shape to products and helps leavening.

7.  PIECES ARE LEFT TO REST ON CONVEYOR BELT

    Exposure to air helps creating a film on the surface of products.

8. PIECES ARE PUT INTO PAPER BAKING CUPS AND LEFT TO LEAVEN

   Pieces are put manually inside paper baking cups and left to leaven in a cell with controlled temperature and humidity.

9. «SCARPATURA» OR ICING

   The phase called «scarpatura» consists in making a cross shaped cut on the surface of the cake. This practice, which has a religious origin, helps leavening and improves aesthetic presentation of the product.

10. BAKING

    Leavening continues inside the oven. Internally the products assume the characteristic appearance with holes and externally they become brown. In case Panettoni are sugar iced, icing become compact and crispy.

11. PRODUCTS ARE LEFT TO COOL UPSIDE DOWN

    After baking, leavened products are left to cool upside down to avoid them to sag. They are kept between two tools similar to rakes. Products are left to cool and dry at room temperature in order to respect their fragrance.
